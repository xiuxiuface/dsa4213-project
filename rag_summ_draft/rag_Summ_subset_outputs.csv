144,Does the Impact of type 2 diabetes on mortality in end-stage renal disease patients differ between genders?,T2DM was associated with death only in females. This association was not constant over time after the first dialysis.,"In diabetics with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), risk of death has been reported to be non-constant after the first dialysis, and different outcomes have been observed between genders. We assessed the impact of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) on mortality in dialysis regarding its differential effect by gender using time-dependent analyses.
