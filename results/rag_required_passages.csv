3601,"Is parathyroid hormone associated with biomarkers of insulin resistance and inflammation, independent of vitamin D status, in obese adolescents?","Metabolic syndrome is associated with a higher iPTH:25(OH)D ratio than those without metabolic syndrome, implying greater risk of cardiovascular morbidities among AA subjects than other ethnic groups. Furthermore, the serum iPTH level is a predictor of chronic inflammation and dyslipidemia, independent of 25(OH)D.","25-Hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and parathyroid hormone (PTH) have been shown to correlate with several markers of metabolic syndrome in adult populations. We evaluated the relationship between circulating intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and 25(OH)D and indices of metabolic syndrome in obese adolescents. Body mass index (BMI), body composition, 25(OH)D, iPTH, fasting lipids, glucose, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin, and the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were evaluated in 133 obese adolescents.",12220,PTH and 25-hydroxyvitamin D correlate with metabolic syndrome biomarkers in obese adolescents.,15.64
4953,Does iGF-2 mediate intestinal mucosal hyperplasia in retinoblastoma protein ( Rb ) -deficient mice?,IGF-2 expression is significantly elevated in villus enterocytes and is required for the hyperplastic intestinal mucosal phenotype of Rb-IKO mice. The trophic effects of IGF2 require intact IGF1R signaling within the intestinal epithelium. These findings reveal novel regulatory roles for Rb in expanding intestinal mucosal surface area.,We have previously demonstrated a hyperplastic phenotype when Rb expression was disrupted within the intestinal epithelium. These findings mimic resection-induced adaptation suggesting a possible mechanistic role for Rb during adaptation. The purpose of the present study was to elucidate a mechanism for how Rb deficiency induces intestinal hyperplasia.,16771,IGF2 mediates intestinal mucosal hyperplasia in retinoblastoma protein-deficient mice.,25.942222222222224
8722,Is insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 level increased in blood of lung cancer patients and associated with poor survival?,"Blood IGFBP2 is significantly increased in lung cancer patients. A high circulating level of IGFBP2 is significantly associated with poor survival, suggesting that blood IGFBP2 levels could be a prognostic biomarker for lung cancer.",We recently showed that IGFBP2 is overexpressed in primary lung cancer tissues. This study aims to determine whether IGFBP2 is elevated in blood samples of lung cancer patients and whether its level is associated with clinical outcomes. Plasma IGFBP2 levels were determined blindly by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 80 lung cancer patients and 80 case-matched healthy controls for comparison.,29568,IGFBP2 is elevated in blood of lung cancer patients and is associated with poor survival.,11.500000000000004
