8568,Does extracellular vesicle protein CD14 relate to common carotid intima-media thickness in eight-year-old children?,"In healthy eight-year old children, extracellular vesicle protein CD14 levels seem positively related to common carotid intima-media thickness. This would point towards inflammatory vascular alterations inflicted by extracellular vesicle protein CD14 already in early life and warrants further investigation.",yes,"Atherosclerosis is a process that begins in childhood, develops over decades and underlies the majority of cardiovascular events in adulthood. Previously, we demonstrated in adults with cardiovascular disease that levels of extracellular vesicle (EV) proteins CD14, Serpin F2 and cystatin C predict vascular outcome. Here, we study for the first time whether these EV proteins are related to vascular characteristics in healthy, young children.",29066
7887,Do differences in glycemic control and survival predict higher ESRD rates in diabetic First Nations adults?,"Elevated rates of ESRD experienced by FN with diabetes are related to poorer glycemic control at all levels of renal function, and lower age-related mortality at advanced stages of chronic kidney disease.",yes,"Diabetic First Nations people (FN) have higher ESRD rates than other Canadians but the reasons remain unclear. We sought to better understand this disparity by comparing demographic, laboratory and survival features of diabetic FN and other Saskatchewan residents (OSK) by renal function stage. Prevalent diabetes cases in 2005/06 were identified in Saskatchewan's two largest health regions using administrative databases, and linked with centralized laboratory tests.",26747
2478,Is ambulatory blood pressure a better marker than clinic blood pressure in predicting cardiovascular events in patients with/without type 2 diabetes?,"These findings suggest that ABPM is a better predictor of cardiovascular risk than clinic BP, and that this holds true for patients with or without T2DM.",yes,"The prognostic significance of ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) has not been established in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). In order to clarify the impact of ABP on cardiovascular prognosis in patients with or without T2DM, we performed ABP monitoring (ABPM) in 1,268 subjects recruited from nine sites in Japan, who were being evaluated for hypertension.

6790,Is hyperandrogenemia independently associated with elevated alanine aminotransferase activity in young women with polycystic ovary syndrome?,"The risk of elevated ALT level is significantly higher in women with PCOS than those without, independent of obesity. The elevated ALT levels in women with PCOS were associated with the increased androgen levels, independent of obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia.",yes,Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have been implicated to have higher levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) because of the high prevalence of obesity. Our aim was to investigate the relationship between elevated ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity and characteristic hyperandrogenism in women with PCOS. We conducted a cross-sectional case-control study in a reproductive endocrinology clinic and voluntary annual medical health check-up program of the health management center in a tertiary medical center.,23038
624,Do angiotensin II receptors modulate muscle microvascular and metabolic responses to insulin in vivo?,"We conclude that both AT(1)Rs and AT(2)Rs regulate insulin's microvascular and metabolic action in muscle. Although AT(1)R activity restrains muscle metabolic responses to insulin via decreased microvascular recruitment and insulin delivery, AT(2)R activity is required for normal microvascular responses to insulin. Thus, pharmacologic manipulation aimed at increasing the AT(2)R-to-AT(1)R activity ratio may afford the potential to improve muscle insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism.",yes,"Angiotensin (ANG) II interacts with insulin-signaling pathways to regulate insulin sensitivity. The type 1 (AT(1)R) and type 2 (AT(2)R) receptors reciprocally regulate basal perfusion of muscle microvasculature. Unopposed AT(2)R activity increases muscle microvascular blood volume (MBV) and glucose extraction, whereas unopposed AT(1)R activity decreases both.",2119
13505,Is metabolic syndrome associated with and predicted by resting heart rate?,Our cross-sectional and longitudinal findings provide evidence that RHR is an independent risk factor for existing MetS and a powerful predictor for future incidence of MetS.,yes,"Although higher resting heart rate (RHR) has emerged as a predictor for lifespan, the underlying mechanisms remain obscure.

468,Do adenosine A ( 1 ) receptors determine glomerular hyperfiltration and the salt paradox in early streptozotocin diabetes mellitus?,"A(1)Rs determine glomerular hyperfiltration and the salt paradox in early diabetes, which is consistent with the tubulocentric principle.",yes,"In early type 1 diabetes mellitus, changes in proximal reabsorption influence glomerular filtration rate (GFR) through tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF). Due to TGF, a primary increase in proximal reabsorption causes early diabetic hyperfiltration, while a heightened sensitivity of the proximal tubule to dietary salt leads to the so-called salt paradox, where a change in dietary salt causes a reciprocal change in GFR ('tubulocentric principle'). Here, experiments were performed in adenosine A(1) receptor knockout mice (A(1)R-/-), which lack an immediate TGF response, to determine whether A(1)Rs are essential for early diabetic hyperfiltration and the salt paradox.",1587
12008,Does subcutaneous administration of liraglutide ameliorate Alzheimer-associated tau hyperphosphorylation in rats with type 2 diabetes?,Our results indicated that subcutaneous administration of liraglutide restores both peripheral and brain insulin sensitivity and ameliorates tau hyperphosphorylation in rats with type 2 diabetes. These findings support the potential use of liraglutide for the prevention and treatment of AD in individuals with type 2 diabetes.,yes,"Type 2 diabetes increases the risk for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Brain insulin resistance contributes to the pathogenesis of AD, and abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau protein is crucial to neurodegeneration.

8515,"Is insulin inversely associated with bone mass, especially in the insulin-resistant population?","There is an inverse relationship between insulin and total body bone mineral content after adjustment for confounding factors in Korean and US subjects, especially in the insulin-resistant population. This strongly suggests that the adverse influence of insulin on bone mass likely reflects the effects of other factors associated with insulin resistance rather than being a direct action of insulin itself.",yes,"Insulin is an important osteotropic hormone but may be negatively associated with bone mass after adjustment for body mass index in adolescent populations. However, the association between insulin and bone mass in adults remains unclear. The objective of the study was to investigate whether insulin was associated with bone mass in adults and, if so, whether the association was positive or negative.",28891
8617,Does diabetes mellitus attenuate the repolarization reserve in mammalian heart?,"It is concluded that type 1 diabetes mellitus, although only moderately, lengthens ventricular repolarization, attenuates the repolarization reserve by decreasing I(to) and I(Ks) currents, and thereby may markedly enhance the risk of sudden cardiac death.",yes,"In diabetes mellitus several cardiac electrophysiological parameters are known to be affected. In rodent experimental diabetes models changes in these parameters were reported, but no such data are available in other mammalian species including the dog. The present study was designed to analyse the effects of experimental type 1 diabetes on ventricular repolarization and its underlying transmembrane ionic currents and channel proteins in canine hearts.",29226

2802,Are serum ghrelin concentrations increased in children with growth hormone insensitivity and decrease during long-term insulinlike growth factor-I treatment?,"Growth hormone resistance and low IGF-I levels are associated with elevated ghrelin levels, which may potentiate GH secretion and adiposity in these children. Suppression of ghrelin during IGF-I treatment suggests a novel mechanism potentially regulating ghrelin levels.",yes,"Ghrelin increases food intake, body weight, and growth hormone (GH) secretion. Serum concentrations of ghrelin are low in obese hyperinsulinemic persons, are reduced by infusion of insulin into normal-weight subjects, and are increased in underweight hypoinsulinemic patients with anorexia nervosa. Laron syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder of GH insensitivity that results in decreased insulinlike growth factor-I (IGF-I) synthesis and growth failure.",9512
2626,Is overexpression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 in skeletal muscle sufficient to enhance fatty acid oxidation and improve high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance?,Our data provide clear evidence that a physiological increase in the capacity of long-chain fatty acyl CoA entry into mitochondria is sufficient to ameliorate lipid-induced insulin resistance in muscle.,yes,"Skeletal muscle insulin resistance is associated with lipid accumulation, but whether insulin resistance is due to reduced or enhanced flux of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria is both controversial and unclear. We hypothesized that skeletal muscle-specific overexpression of the muscle isoform of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), the enzyme that controls the entry of long-chain fatty acyl CoA into mitochondria, would enhance rates of fatty acid oxidation and improve insulin action in muscle in high-fat diet insulin-resistant rats.

9749,"Is not only accumulation, but also saturation status of intramuscular lipids significantly affected by PPARγ activation?","These findings support the conclusion that not only the change in total lipid content (DAG and TAG), but also FA composition is affected by rosiglitazone in an animal model of high-fat-diet-induced insulin resistance.",yes,"Intramuscular lipid accumulation has been associated with insulin resistance, and after thiazolidinediones (TZD) treatment, it was shown to be reduced in some, but not all, studies. This work was undertaken to investigate the relationships between intramuscular lipids [free fatty acids (FFA), diacylglycerols (DAG), triacylglycerol (TAG) and phospholipids] and plasmalemmal expression of fatty acid (FA) transporter [FAT/CD36 and FABPpm] in the muscles of varying oxidative capacity, after peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma (PPARγ) activation (rosiglitazone) in an animal model of high-fat-diet-induced insulin resistance. Endurance training was also included to further explore the differences in these relationships.",33049
2807,Are proliferation of colo-357 pancreatic carcinoma cells and survival of patients with pancreatic carcinoma altered by insulin glargine?,Regular human insulin and insulin glargine may be used to treat diabetes in patients with pancreatic cancer.,no,"It was reported that the long-acting insulin analogue glargine induces cell proliferation in a human osteosarcoma cell line and therefore might induce or accelerate tumor growth. Induction of cell proliferation would be particularly relevant for insulin treatment of subjects with diabetes and the potential of bearing tumor cells (e.g., a history of a malignant disease). Proliferation, apoptosis, and the expression levels of insulin receptor, IGF-I receptor, and insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 2 were analyzed in human pancreatic cancer cells (Colo-357) after incubation (72 h) with insulin glargine or regular human insulin at 0-100 nmol/l.",9530
4029,Is mice body weight gain prevented after naked human leptin cDNA transfer into skeletal muscle by electroporation?,The present study provides evidence of successful electroporation of naked plasmid DNA transfer for prevention or treatment of mice obesity.,yes,"In this investigation, the feasibility of gene therapy for obesity by electroporational transfer of naked plasmid with leptin cDNA into skeletal muscle was tested. Both young and adult mice were studied. Human leptin cDNA was attached to the human insulin precursor secretion signal peptide gene.",13648
5614,Does treatment with recombinant tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand alleviate the severity of streptozotocin-induced diabetes?,"Overall, these data demonstrate that the administration of recombinant TRAIL ameliorates the severity of STZ-induced type 1 diabetes, and this effect was accompanied by the upregulation of SOCS1 expression.",yes,To evaluate the potential therapeutic effect of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) treatment in a model of type 1 diabetes. Recombinant TRAIL was added in vitro to primary human and mouse peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and isolated human islets to evaluate the expression of the immunoregulatory gene SOCS1. Diabetes was induced by five consecutive daily injections of low-concentration (50 mg/kg) streptozotocin (STZ) in C57 black mice (n = 24).,19012
